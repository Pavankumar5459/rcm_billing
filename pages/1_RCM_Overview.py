Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the financial backbone of healthcare organizations. It encompasses the
entire process from patient scheduling through final payment collection.

A well-designed RCM process ensures timely reimbursement, reduces administrative burden,
and improves patient trust by preventing billing surprises.

Key phases include registration, eligibility verification, authorization, coding,
claim submission, adjudication, denial management, and payment posting.
